# Training Materials and Workflows

This document outlines the theoretical training materials and the workflow expectations for both trainees and SOC analysts operating within the KYPO cyber range environment.

## Theoretical Background

Trainees should familiarize themselves with fundamental concepts in network security, incident response, and malware analysis prior to beginning exercises. Recommended topics include:

- Fundamentals of TCP/IP networking
- Common attack vectors and the kill chain methodology
- Basics of log analysis and threat intelligence
- Overview of Security Operations Center (SOC) responsibilities

## Trainee Workflow

1. **Scenario Preparation** – Review the scenario description and objectives. Ensure access to required accounts and tools within CyberRangeCZ.
2. **Hands-on Investigation** – Execute the provided scenario or malware simulation, collect evidence, and document observations.
3. **Reporting** – Compile findings into an incident report, highlighting indicators of compromise and suggested mitigations.

## SOC Analyst Workflow

1. **Monitoring** – Continuously observe alerts and logs from NG-SOC tools such as Wazuh, Suricata, and Zeek.
2. **Triage and Analysis** – Validate alerts, correlate data across tools, and escalate significant events.
3. **Response** – Coordinate containment or remediation actions and document all steps taken for post-incident review.

These workflows ensure that trainees gain practical experience while SOC analysts maintain operational readiness within the simulated environment.
