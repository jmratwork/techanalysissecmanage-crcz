# Training Materials and Workflows

This document outlines the theoretical training materials and the workflow expectations for both trainees and instructors operating within the KYPO cyber range environment. The primary scenario focuses on penetration testing and vulnerability assessment training using a Cyber Range environment that mirrors CYNET's network. Participants learn how to discover and document vulnerabilities while following organizational procedures.

## Theoretical Background

Trainees should familiarize themselves with fundamental concepts in network security, incident response, and malware analysis prior to beginning exercises. Recommended topics include:

- Fundamentals of TCP/IP networking
- Common attack vectors and the kill chain methodology
- Basics of log analysis and threat intelligence
- Overview of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing methodologies

## Trainee Workflow

1. **Scenario Preparation** – Review the scenario description and objectives. Ensure access to required accounts and tools within CyberRangeCZ.
2. **Hands-on Investigation** – Use the training platform to follow course instructions and run semi-automated penetration tests against the Cyber Range.
3. **Reporting** – Compile findings into an assessment report, highlighting discovered vulnerabilities, applicable policy references, and suggested mitigations.

## Instructor Workflow

1. **Monitoring** – Ensure the Cyber Range and training platform are functioning and collect trainee reports.
2. **Evaluation** – Review results, correlate findings where necessary, and provide feedback or remediation guidance.

## Subcase 1c: Malware Handling

### Trainee Activities

1. **Lab Deployment** – Start the Subcase 1c lab in the KYPO interface. *Validation:* confirm all virtual machines show a **running** state in the platform dashboard. *Artifacts:* screenshot of the deployment status and exported topology details.
2. **Run Malware Simulator** – Execute the provided malware simulator script inside the designated victim machine. *Validation:* the simulator must output a "simulation completed" message and create traffic logs on the host. *Artifacts:* terminal output log and generated host log files.
3. **Observation in NG-SIEM/NG-SOC** – Monitor the NG-SIEM/NG-SOC consoles for alerts generated by the simulator traffic. *Validation:* expected alert identifiers appear in the console with correlated events. *Artifacts:* exported alert report or screenshots of the correlated events.
4. **CTI Ingestion** – Ingest the threat indicators produced by the simulator into the CTI module. *Validation:* the ingestion log shows the indicators accepted and mapped to corresponding alerts. *Artifacts:* CTI feed file and ingestion confirmation log.
5. **Final Evaluation** – Submit findings through the platform’s evaluation form. *Validation:* the platform marks the exercise as completed and records the submission. *Artifacts:* final assessment report and platform submission receipt.

### Instructor Activities

1. **Lab Deployment** – Verify each trainee’s lab deployment using the KYPO control interface. *Validation:* orchestrator logs show successful provisioning of all machines. *Artifacts:* deployment logs and metrics exported from the interface.
2. **Run Malware Simulator** – Monitor simulator execution via remote console or log streaming. *Validation:* simulator run completes without errors and produces expected network activity. *Artifacts:* captured console output and packet capture files.
3. **Observation in NG-SIEM/NG-SOC** – Confirm alerts appear in NG-SIEM/NG-SOC and correlate with simulator activity. *Validation:* matching alert IDs and correlation graphs are visible. *Artifacts:* SIEM export files and screenshots of correlation graphs.
4. **CTI Ingestion** – Ensure trainees submit CTI data and that indicators link to SIEM alerts. *Validation:* CTI module logs show successful ingestion and linkage to alert IDs. *Artifacts:* CTI ingestion logs and mapped indicator lists.
5. **Final Evaluation** – Review submitted reports and platform evaluation results. *Validation:* each trainee’s submission status is recorded in the grading dashboard. *Artifacts:* completed grading rubric and evaluation summaries.

These workflows ensure that trainees gain practical experience while instructors maintain oversight within the simulated environment.

## Post-Incident Reporting and Iteration

Run `subcase_1c/scripts/generate_post_incident_report.sh` once evaluations are complete to gather NG‑SIEM, BIPS and Act logs. Review the resulting file in `reports/` following the guidance in `docs/post_incident_process.md` and update playbooks or teaching materials accordingly before the next training cycle.
