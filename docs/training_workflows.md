# Training Materials and Workflows

This document outlines the theoretical training materials and the workflow expectations for both trainees and instructors operating within the KYPO cyber range environment. The primary scenario focuses on penetration testing and vulnerability assessment training using a Cyber Range environment that mirrors CYNET's network. Participants learn how to discover and document vulnerabilities while following organizational procedures.

## Theoretical Background

Trainees should familiarize themselves with fundamental concepts in network security, incident response, and malware analysis prior to beginning exercises. Recommended topics include:

- Fundamentals of TCP/IP networking
- Common attack vectors and the kill chain methodology
- Basics of log analysis and threat intelligence
- Overview of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing methodologies

## Trainee Workflow

1. **Scenario Preparation** – Review the scenario description and objectives. Ensure access to required accounts and tools within CyberRangeCZ.
2. **Hands-on Investigation** – Use the training platform to follow course instructions and run semi-automated penetration tests against the Cyber Range.
3. **Reporting** – Compile findings into an assessment report, highlighting discovered vulnerabilities, applicable policy references, and suggested mitigations.

## Instructor Workflow

1. **Monitoring** – Ensure the Cyber Range and training platform are functioning and collect trainee reports.
2. **Evaluation** – Review results, correlate findings where necessary, and provide feedback or remediation guidance.

These workflows ensure that trainees gain practical experience while instructors maintain oversight within the simulated environment.
