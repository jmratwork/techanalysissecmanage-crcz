# Subcase 1c Malware Handling Training

## Objective
Design a comprehensive cyber security training plan focused on handling and mitigating malware attacks. This proactive approach
involves theoretical and practical training on the utilization of automation techniques, tools and technologies, and incident response procedures to detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from malware attacks. Through this subcase, CYNET will improve its
protection capabilities and capacities using state-of-the-art technology and solutions to better prepare, detect, and stop malware attacks. Furthermore, relevant intelligence (CTI) is shared with the appropriate audience (other entities and authorities) to enhance collective defense efforts and improve overall cybersecurity resilience.

Simulate benign malware activity and integrate threat intelligence feeds to exercise NG-SOAR components.

This subcase is **hands-on**. Analysts can inspect outputs in the NG-SIEM dashboards at `http://localhost:5602`, review MISP entries at `https://localhost:8443`, and examine raw logs under `/var/log/bips/` and the Act service log directory.

## Node Roles
- **infected_host** – Windows victim that runs the benign malware simulator
- **c2_server** – Command-and-control server for beaconing traffic
- **soc_server** – Hosts NG-SOAR platform services
- **cti_component** – Runs MISP and feeds threat intelligence to the SOC

## Required NG-SOAR Components
- BIPS
- NG-SIEM
- NG-SOAR
- CICMS
- MISP

For a cross-reference of tools, versions, and documentation, see the [NG-SOAR components matrix](../docs/ngsoar_components_matrix.md).

## Workflow
1. **Service initialization** – The instructor provisions the exercise inside the RandomSec LMS and launches NG-SOAR services with [scripts/start_soc_services.sh](scripts/start_soc_services.sh).
2. **CTI ingestion** – The trainee activates the CTI component using [scripts/start_cti_component.sh](scripts/start_cti_component.sh) so threat intelligence flows into the SOC.
3. **SOC analysis** – Acting as a SOC analyst, the trainee investigates alerts produced by [scripts/start_c2_server.sh](scripts/start_c2_server.sh) and [scripts/benign_malware_simulator.ps1](scripts/benign_malware_simulator.ps1), documenting findings in the platform.
4. **Automated mitigation** – NG-SIEM and BIPS forward events to the Decide service, which recommends responses consumed by the Act orchestrator.
5. **Instructor feedback** – Results and lessons learned are submitted back through the RandomSec LMS where instructors review the analysis and provide guidance.

## Execution Steps
> **Note:** The startup scripts in this subcase expect `systemctl`. If systemd is unavailable, run them with `DIRECT_START=1` in the environment. When this flag is set the scripts will try `service` first and, if that is missing, start each component directly.
1. **Start SOC services**
   ```bash
   sudo subcase_1c/scripts/start_soc_services.sh
   ```
2. **Start the CTI component**
   ```bash
   sudo subcase_1c/scripts/start_cti_component.sh
   ```
3. **Launch the C2 server**
   ```bash
   sudo subcase_1c/scripts/start_c2_server.sh
   ```
4. **Run the Windows malware simulator**
   ```powershell
   $env:BEACON_URL = "http://localhost:5601/beacon"  # optional override
   .\subcase_1c\scripts\benign_malware_simulator.ps1 -BeaconCount 3
   ```

5. **Query mitigation recommendations**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/recommend \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"source":"ng-siem","severity":5}'
   ```

## Playbook Execution Examples
The Act service now leverages a lightweight **SoarEngine** that parses CACAO JSON playbooks from `subcase_1c/playbooks/`. Each playbook defines a starting action and a set of ordered actions. When an incident is posted to `/act`, the engine renders commands with the provided target and prints the simulated execution steps.

### Response
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/act \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"target":"192.168.56.10","mitigation":"response"}'
```

### Elimination
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/act \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"target":"192.168.56.10","mitigation":"elimination"}'
```

### Recovery
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/act \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"target":"192.168.56.10","mitigation":"recovery"}'
```

Playbooks can be edited and validated with:

```bash
python subcase_1c/scripts/validate_playbooks.py
```

## Smoke Test
Run a quick end-to-end validation of the training environment:

```bash
sudo subcase_1c/scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

The script runs the benign malware simulator and checks for the resulting NG-SIEM alert, IRIS case, MISP event, and NG-SOAR playbook execution.
